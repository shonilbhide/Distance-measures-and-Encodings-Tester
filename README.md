# Distance Measures and Encodings Tester

- A string metric provides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of distance.
- There are several ways to measure the distance between two strings.
- Various ways exist to encode strings into encodings based on various algorithms.
- This facilitates finding the distance between strings, considering typing errors, phonetic errors, or different spellings used in various geographic locations.

## Contents
This repository contains a list of:

- Available distance metrics
- String encoding functions

You can use a combination of these to test various encodings and the distance between them.
