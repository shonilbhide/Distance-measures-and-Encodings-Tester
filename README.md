# Distance-measures-and-Encodings-Tester
A string metric provides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of distance.
There are several ways to measure the distance between two strings. 
Similarly there are various ways to encode strings into encodngs,based on various algorithms.This helps to find distance between strings, 
which might be different due to some typing errors,phonetic errors or having different spellings used in different geographic locations.
This file contains a List of available distance metrices and string encoding functions.You can use a combination of these to test various encodings and the distance between them.
